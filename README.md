# Serverless Invoices by Moku

Serverless Invoices is a free invoicing tool for freelancers and small businesses.

It is open-source and easily extendable. You can use it as a starter kit for more complex systems. Implement your own features, localization, styling
 or integrate with various other systems and API-s.
 
Run it locally or host it yourself.
 
You can always use the latest free version at [invoices.mokuapp.io](https://invoices.mokuapp.io)

Built with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

<details>
  <summary><strong>How is data stored? (IndexedDB via LocalForage)</strong></summary>

  The app is a client-side SPA that persists your data in the browser using
  <code>localforage</code> (IndexedDB under the hood).

  - Storage config: see <code>src/config/local-storage.config.js</code> (DB name <code>serverlessInvoices</code>).
  - Default adapter: <code>storageType: 'local'</code> in <code>src/config/app.config.js</code>.
  - Scope: data is scoped per-origin (protocol + host + port). Switching domain/port or clearing site data resets it.
  - Backup/migrate: use Export/Import (Invoices page â†’ three-dots menu) to download/upload <code>serverless-invoices.json</code>.
  - Implementation refs: <code>src/store/data.js</code> (exportJson/importJson), <code>src/components/ImportModal.vue</code>.

  Advanced: HTTP/WordPress adapters exist but require your own backend/API and proper CORS/auth configuration.
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Who generates the PDF?</strong></summary>

  The PDF is generated by the <em>client browser</em> using the print dialog.

  - Action: "Download PDF" triggers <code>window.print()</code> (see <code>src/components/invoices/InvoiceControls.vue</code>).
  - Print view: <code>src/views/InvoicePrint.vue</code> renders the invoice with print-friendly CSS.
  - To save: choose "Save as PDF" in your browser's print dialog.
  - No server-side rendering is used in the default setup.

## Project setup

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use `Make up` to build and run the project locally via container. Go to `localhost:80` to access the app.

Requires `node 16.18` for local installation

```
npm install
```

### Create app config
Create an app.config.js which can be edited for custom settings.
```
cp src/config/app.config.example.js src/config/app.config.js
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

> Note: The SPA history routing fallback is included automatically via `public/_redirects` so that static hosts (e.g., Cloudflare Pages, Netlify) serve `index.html` for deep links. This ensures Vue Router in history mode works after refreshes and direct URL visits.

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

## Run with Docker

It is necessary to install Docker before running the following commands.

```
git clone https://github.com/mokuappio/serverless-invoices.git
cd serverless-invoices.git
docker build . -t serverless-invoices
docker run -p 80:8080 -d --rm serverless-invoices
```

It is possible to add an alias in your .bashrc/.zshrc file to launch the app on the fly.

```
echo "alias serverless-invoices='docker run -p 80:8080 -d --rm serverless-invoices'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
serverless-invoices
```
